# HDD
### This code is Hawaii Disambiguity Decoder (HDD) under SPIN4D project.
### It is used to disambiguate the azimuthal angle of 
### the magnetic field from the Stokes polarimetric data inversion
### It can give disambiguate the horizontal magnetic field with 180 degree
### ambiguity and give the prediction of the vertical height based on the 
### divergence equaton only. 
### This is only a very week constraint on the data but works well.
