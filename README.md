# HDD
### This code is Hawaii Disambiguity Decoder (HDD) under the SPIN4D project.
### It is used to reconstruct the 3D solar lower atmosphere, e.g., solar photosphere, based on ambiguited vector magnetogram on multiple optical layers.
### It can disambiguate the azimuthal angle of the inverted magnetic field and predict the geometric height simultaneously.
### The algorithm is described in Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): II. A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Method for 3D Solar Photosphere Reconstruction, submitted to ApJ.
