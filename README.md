# HDD
### This code is Hawaii Disambiguity Decoder (HDD) under the SPIN4D project.
### It is used to disambiguate the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field from the Stokes polarimetric data inversion.
### It can disambiguate the horizontal magnetic field with a 180-degree
### ambiguity and give the prediction of the vertical height based on the 
### divergence equation only. 
### This is only a very week constraint on the data, but it works well.
